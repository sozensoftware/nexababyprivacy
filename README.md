Privacy Policy
This privacy policy applies to the NexaBaby app (hereby referred to as "Application") for mobile devices that was created by Sozen Software (hereby referred to as "Service Provider") as a Freemium service. This service is intended for use "AS IS".
Information Collection and Use
The Application collects information when you download and use it. This information may include information such as:
Your device's Internet Protocol address (e.g. IP address)
The pages of the Application that you visit, the time and date of your visit, the time spent on those pages
The time spent on the Application
The operating system you use on your mobile device
The Application does not gather precise information about the location of your mobile device.
NexaBaby primarily uses Anonymous Authentication to provide a seamless experience without requiring your email address or phone number upfront. However, if you contact support, your email address will be retained to respond to your inquiry.
Image Data and AI Generation
Our Application's core feature allows you to generate artistic portraits using Artificial Intelligence. This requires you to upload a source image. Our policy regarding these images is as follows:
Processing: The photos you upload are sent securely to our third-party AI service providers (such as Replicate) solely for the purpose of generating the requested image based on your text prompt.
No Training: We do not use your personal photos to train public AI models.
Retention: The original source photo is discarded from the processing server after the generation is complete. The generated result images are stored in your private cloud gallery (Firebase Storage) linked to your anonymous ID so you can access them later within the app.
Third Party Access
Only aggregated, anonymized data is periodically transmitted to external services to aid the Service Provider in improving the Application and their service. The Service Provider may share your information with third parties in the ways that are described in this privacy statement.
Please note that the Application utilizes third-party services that have their own Privacy Policy about handling data. Below are the links to the Privacy Policy of the third-party service providers used by the Application:

In-App Purchases (Diamonds)
NexaBaby offers virtual credits ("Diamonds") to generate images. Transactions are processed by the Apple App Store or Google Play Store. We do not store your financial information. We use RevenueCat to manage and validate your credit balance securely using an anonymous user identifier.
Opt-Out Rights

Data Retention Policy
